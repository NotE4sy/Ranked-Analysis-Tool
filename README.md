# Ranked Analysis Tool

Tool to check a player's average splits and timestamps for their past x <= 50 matches

For linux I have no idea how it works so gl :/

For mac gatekeeper will block it because of course it will so you'll have to choose to open it from your settings > gatekeeper > open anyways or smth

Honestly wtf do you add in a README man :/
